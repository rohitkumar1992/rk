                        <p>Firstly, Levels are aimed at promoting an overall healthy environment and not to favour anybody. We want our users to directly rate Vendors and Sellers to let other users know about the skills and qualities of a Vendor or a Seller. We feel that by providing our users with an option to rate a Seller or a Vendor, we empower them to have their say about what they have experienced and availed. This also promotes user engagements and motivates Vendors and Sellers to take their work to the next level.</p>
